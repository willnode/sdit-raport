The usual stuff I start with when i'm working with custom website.

### What's inside

A simple website with CRUD access on user accounts and articles.

### Setup

1. Clone the project
2. Configure DB connection (or just create database `example`)
3. `composer install`
4. `php spark migrate`
5. `php spark serve`
